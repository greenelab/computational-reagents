  Tasks that participants must complete are set apart from other elements of the
  presentation as shown below. Due dates are indicated. Participants must
  complete all elements by these due dates to participate during in person
  discussions:

.task[
**Before 8:00 AM on January 26**:

- count to ten.

- read [Stodden et al.](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah6168)

# Why make my work reproducible and transparent?

- Reproducibility is a basic principle of science.

- Repeatable workflows make our lives easier.

- We want to graduate one day, so we can't be irreplaceable to our lab.

- You are a science giant and can help others see further.

# Why make my work reproducible and transparent?

.task[
**Before 8:00 AM on February 1**, carefully consider important reasons and file a
[pull request](https://github.com/greenelab/computational-reagents/edit/master/index.html)
to add your own reasons to this slide. If you need more information about how to
do this, see the [README](https://github.com/greenelab/computational-reagents/).
Add a new bullet point with:
- your point here!
- because I want to be accountable for my conclusions. If my work is solid, transparent and reproducible, but my results are misleading, itâ€™s justifiable to have faulty conclusions. They will be corrected over time with more samples, additional tests, etc.
- because we would not want to end up like our colleagues in Psychology: ["Over half of psychology studies fail reproducibility test"](https://goo.gl/IJw4Nh)
- I want to make my work reproducible and transparent so that I won't have to think about it ever again and can move forward in my life.
- Ethical obligation. 
- Foster a positive reputation among colleagues.       
- So that when I or others want to repeat an experiment (especially after a long period of time) there is a reference that can be used to repeat it exactly, troubleshoot, and/or improve upon it. 
- By making my work transparent, I can get input from others, and thus save time from trying methods that don't work or find gaps in the way I am thinking about a problem. 
- to make sure I agree with my scientific ethics.

Any source code that is used from data collection to the conclusion of your
analyses. This includes:

- pre-processing code (adapter trimming, etc).

- the nuts and bolts of your analysis.

- code that generates the plots used to compose figures.

This is a non-exclusive list. If you can't get the same results without it,
you need it.

  #### Data
]
.right-column[
Any data that you analyze to the extent possible. Some genetic data can not be
shared without restrictions. In these cases, you should take alternate steps to
help others confirm that they have the same data. Readers should be able to
easily obtain:

- any data that does not have sharing restrictions.

- for data that can't be shared, can you compute a
[hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum)?

- for data that can't be shared, provide an example file with dummy values.

- the [random seed(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) that you used.

This is also a non-exclusive list. If you can't get the same results without it,
  you need to preserve and, if possible, share it under an
  [open license](http://opendefinition.org/) that permits re-use.

  #### Source Code

]
.right-column[
Don't overlook your computing environment. The software that you have installed
can change the results that you observe. This is particularly true for:

- [versions](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1439189) of your
programming language(s).

- [versions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new.html#enhancements) of
packages and software libraries that you use?

- items that are [tied to our understanding of the genome](http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/CDF_download.asp).

This is also a non-exclusive list. If you can't get the same results without it,
  you need to preserve and share it. Ideally under an
  [open license](https://opensource.org/) that permits re-use.

What did you do and when did you do it? The lab notebook is a critically
important tool for scientists to track and share this information. In the
computational sciences, we have a number of means available to us. But we have
to use them carefully! Inadequate use may compromise our ability to nail down
what we did when.

- [Version control](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947) can record
what code existed at which time.

- [Preprints](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201670030) can result in
[feedback above and beyond](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/issues/110)
what you receive during peer review. We must aim to get things right. Preprints
are a tool to help us do this.

.right-column[
We haven't discussed how you should store and share these items. Digital
artifacts - that is your source code, data, and compute environment - should be
archived and disseminated. Where can you store these items?

- [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org) offers a service at no cost that connects to
GitHub to [capture releases as citeable objects](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).

- [figshare](https://figshare.com/) offers a [similar service that can auto-sync
each release](https://support.figshare.com/support/solutions/articles/6000150264-how-to-connect-figshare-with-your-github-account).

- [Institutional repositories](http://repository.upenn.edu/about.html). I'm not
currently aware of a Penn service designed for code, data, or compute
environments.

Things that you should look for in an archiving source: Are authors unable to
delete their own uploads? Does the artifact receive a digital object identifier
(doi)? [This paper](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097) discusses
important considerations.

# What tools exist to help out?

Find and share:
.task[
**Before 8:00 AM on January 26**, consider tools for reproducible and
transparent research that you have used or heard of before. Add an
[issue](https://github.com/greenelab/computational-reagents/issues) for a tool
that nobody else has filed an issue on yet. Put the tool's name in the issue's
title. In the issue text, explain whether you think the tool is necessary,
sufficient, helpful, or irrelevant to transparent and reproducible
computational research.
]

And evaluate other contributions:

.task[
**Before 8:00 AM on February 1**, comment on at least three other
[issues](https://github.com/greenelab/computational-reagents/issues). Learn
about the tool if necessary, and explain whether you think the tool is
necessary, sufficient, helpful, or irrelevant to transparent and reproducible
computational research.
]

# Evaluate the literature.

.task[

**Before 8:00 AM on February 1**, evaluate preprints or peer reviewed papers:

- Find one that you think exemplifies reproducibility and transparency.

- Find one that you think exhibits poor reproducibility, transparency, or both.

- Find one that you are a coauthor on. If you haven't written a paper yet,
find one from your current lab.

Post links to each paper in this [github issue](https://github.com/greenelab/computational-reagents/issues/4).
