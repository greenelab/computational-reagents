# Tips for Greater Reproducibility and Transparency in Computational Biology

Here are some best practices and tools that we came up with during our meeting, as suggestions to increase reproducibility and transparency in our work as computational biologists.

## Best Practices in R&T
### Essential to Have:
- Data (Assuming no Legal/Moral Restrictions)
- "Sufficient" Metadata (i.e. sufficient for reproducibility)
- Source Code
- Computational Environment/Software Versioning
- Electronic Notebook with Timestamps

### Recommended to Have:
- Metadata with Experimental Design
- Well Documented Source Code
- Persistent DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for Software & Data

### Nice to Have:
- Documentation of Available Parameters
- License for Software & Data
- Example File(s)

## Tools for R&T
### Essential to Have:
- Git/Mercurial (via GitHub/BitBucket)

### Nice to Have:
- Zenodo/Figshare
- Docker/Virtual Machine
